# SmartLab Agent Notes

- Follow the dark industrial UI language described in `docs/SMARTLAB_CONTEXT.md`.
- Keep components typed and modular, preferring functional React patterns.
- Always update snapshots or mock data when adjusting layout cards.
- Document any new reusable primitives directly in their file headers.
